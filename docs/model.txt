Model
	derives from TreeNode

DESCR
	The Model class is used as a repository for the data shown in views. Views are widgets derived from the View class
	and to them a Model is assigned. The same Model can be assigned to different views so the same data can be displayed in
	different widgets.
	Each Model object is a node of a tree and so can contain one or more children.
	The data associated with a model node is represented by a list of strings.

	This class cannot be directly instantiated but it must be create using the Master::CreateModel() function.

METHODS

*
void appendChild ( std::vector<std::string> const & string_list, std::string const &style_name = "default" )
	- adds a new child to the end of the child list of this model node. The child is filled with the specified vector of strings.
	  <style_name> specifies the name of a style to be used by views when displaying this item.
	  The style is defined in the StyleManager object.
	  NOTE: this method cannot be dynamically called.


*
void appendChild ( std::string const & val, std::string const &style_name = "default" )
	- adds a new child to the end of the child list of this model node. The child is filled with just one string.
	  <style_name> specifies the name of a style to be used by views when displaying this item.
	  The style is defined in the StyleManager object.
	  NOTE: this method cannot be dynamically called.


*
void appendChild ( TreeNode * child )
	- adds the specified child to the end of the child list of this model node.


*
void insertChild ( TreeNode * child, int pos )
	- inserts the specified child at the specified position of the child list of this model node.


*
void removeChild ( int pos )
	- removes the child at the specified position of the child list.


*
void removeAllChildren ()
	- removes all the children of the model


*
void setChild ( TreeNode * new_child, int pos )
	- substitutes the child at the specified position of the child list with <new_child>


*
xgui::Model * getChild ( int pos )
	- returns the child at the specified position of the child list.


*
xgui::Model * findByPath ( std::string const &path )
	- returns a child giving its path (see TreeNode::path())


*
void setFlag(unsigned long flag)
	- set a flag for this model node. <flag> is a bit mask specifying the bits that are to be set.


*
void unsetFlag(unsigned long flag)
	- unset a flag for this model node. <flag> is a bit mask specifying the bits that are to be unset.


*
bool getFlagStatus(unsigned long flag)
	- returns true if the specified flags are set. <flag> is a bit mask specifying the bits that are to be checked.
	

*
void setStyle ( std::string const & style_name )
	- sets the visual style to be used by style-managed views when displaying this model element.


*
std::string const & getStyle()
	- returns the name of the style assigned to this model element.


*
void addString(std::string const &str)
	- adds a string to the string list of this model element


*
void delString(int pos)
	- removes the string at the specified position of the string list of this model element

*
void setString(std::string const &str, int pos)
	- substitutes the string at the specified position of the string list of this model element with <str>


*
const std::string & getString ( int pos )
	- returns the string of the specified position of the string list of this model element.


*
void clearStrings()
	- removes all strings of this model element


*
void updateViews()
	- refreshes all the views associated with this model (calling the refresh() method on each view).

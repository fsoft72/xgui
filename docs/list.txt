DESCR
	List widget is a widget that represents a group of data items placing them
	on a grid of rows and columns. The data are gathered from the model.


METHODS

*
void addColumn ( int cpos, const std::string & cid, const std::string & cname, int cwidth = 100, const std::string & calign = "left" )
	- adds a column to the list widget.
	The column will be added at position <cpos>, will be identified by
	<cid> and will be displayed as <cname>.
	The list will arrange the columns trying to mantain the given minimum
	size specified by <cwidth> and the given alignment specified by
	<calign>
	
	NOTE: on Win32 platform if the column position <cpos> is set to 0 then the text is always left-aligned.


*
void delColumn ( const std::string & id )
	- removes the specified column from the list widget.


*
void sort ( const std::string & column_id, xgui::TextPairCallback * callback )
